<h1> Web F. Site </h1>

<P> We are building a customized social network for the Terrace F. Club.  The site will fill all the roles that club &#34email spam list&#34 might typically fill, but it will avoid the associated annoyance by supporting conversation threads and allowing members to tag and dynamically filter content.  The site will also allow officers to distribute important announcements, such as menus and event information, that members can then easily search. In short, the site will act as a digital clubhouse for club members - a space where they can build a digital community that complements the interactions they have every day and encourages new ones.

<P> You can access the site at <a href="http://webfsite.herokuapp.com">http://webfsite.herokuapp.com</a>. You will need a Facebook account to log in.

<P> Contact jasnyder@princeton.edu in case anything horrible happens.
