<h1> Web F. Site Report </h1>

<span class="c1 c2">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0 c4">

<span class="c1">Development of the Web F. site has been both considerably challenging and immensely rewarding. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">When we conceived of the project we were motivated by a common gripe: &nbsp;we felt that Terrace&rsquo;s archaic digital communications were badly in need of a change. We were tired of the one-way listserv that our club has traditionally utilized, yet we didn&rsquo;t think that an open spam-list was a good solution. &nbsp;We wanted to create a custom social network that would include all the best parts of listserv, and also include some features to specifically benefit a small social community like Terrace. &nbsp;This site would be a communication platform that could support the club&rsquo;s need to communicate important information while simultaneously enhancing communication between members and building community within the club. By setting aggressive deadlines, establishing an efficient workflow, and delegating tasks effectively, we have built a product that realizes these goals to a large degree, and that will be deployed as a permanent member&rsquo;s section of the Terrace website. &nbsp; In this final report, we will offer some commentary on the work we&rsquo;ve done, our design process, potential future work, and our impression of the assignment as a whole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Milestones</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the outset of the project, we were faced with a fundamental choice about how we would pace its development - we could &nbsp;schedule aggressively and release an beta test early in the development stages, or we could delay release until a significant amount of development had been done. &nbsp;The early release had the advantage of providing early user feedback that would allow us to design to our user&rsquo;s needs more intelligently, while the delayed release would allow us to present a more polished and attractive product to our initial audience.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Since our biggest goal for the project was to create something that members our club would actually use, we decided to push for an early release, and intentionally set aggressive initial milestones. &nbsp;Our initial schedule called for a bare-bones beta release on April first, and for the completion of more advanced features such as @-mentions, formal announcements and menus, threading, and filtering incrementally through the month of April. &nbsp;This decision was informed by the assumption that basic site functionality such as login, permissions, posting, and deletion would be easy to implement, while more advanced functionality such as specialized posts, threading, filtering, and user interface features would be more difficult and time consuming. &nbsp;In reality, the reverse proved true - building and debugging the site fundamentals proved to be the most challenging and time-consuming parts of the process. &nbsp;As a result, we were unable to meet our aggressive beta deadline, and did not open the site to users until it was nearly complete.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">On the other hand, once the foundation of the site was complete we were able to add a number of interesting advanced features very quickly. &nbsp;Hashtags and @-mentions, for example, were completed over the course of just a few days. &nbsp;By the time we got around to implementing these more advanced features, we were also much more familiar with Django than when we began, which was an enormous advantage. &nbsp;This is a testament to the power of the Django framework - in the hands of an experienced user, it can be used to create complex site features very quickly. &nbsp;Nothing in our project illustrates this better than post text search, which was implemented with the following code:</span></p><p class="c0 c4 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">containing = UserPost.objects.filter(Q(text__iregex= searchTerm) |Q(comment__text__iregex= searchTerm)).distinct()</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This elegant (and somewhat cryptic) manipulation of the Django ORM that returns exactly what we want with a single line of python. &nbsp;For the experienced user this concise representation is very convenient, but for a beginner it can be frustrating - had we been asked to produce this search code six weeks ago, we would have thrown up our hands in despair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we did not meet the aggressive deadlines we set for ourselves, they proved very beneficial in the long run as an incentive to front-load effort on the project and avoid last-minute scrambling. The going was slow at first, but the foundations we laid and experience we gained in these early stages allowed us to complete all of our planned features by the deadline, as well as some additional features (such as facebook friending) that we had not initially planned to implement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Design</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Workflow</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">We established a standardized working environment very early on in the project which streamlined the development process. Virtualenv allowed us to develop in a unified environment with the same exact version of every piece of framework software and all dependencies. This enabled us to develop and test our application on each of our machines without the possibility of version conflicts while working in the same remote git repository.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Front-End Design</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">The front end of site was developed in three design iterations. In the first iteration, the feed page displayed a linen background with a centered stack of posts. Although the design was suitable for readability purposes, it was awkward to display a user&rsquo;s name and profile picture. The stack nature of the feed did not lend itself to an elegant display of personal information and straightforward navigation. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">In the second iteration, the initial design was scrapped for a simple one column, black nav bar, white background design. This was simple and a large improvement from the original design. We actually are fond of the centered, one column layout of this second iteration of the feed, but because of the demands of our navigation bar and search functionality, we opted, in our third iteration, for a two-column layout, with main content aligned left, and search/hashtag functionality--when appropriate--aligned right.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">As far as our design process is concerned, we operated mostly inside of the browser. Although, from time to time, we&rsquo;d mock-up something on paper, mostly we designed with Firebug and Chrome Developer Tools (depending on whether we were working in Firefox or Chrome). We never made use of Photoshop or Balsamiq for layout mockups and we actually don&rsquo;t regret this. Our design process was fast and scrappy. We were able to move quickly and purposefully just by writing vanilla HTML and CSS. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">One of our major regrets about our design process is not using dynamic stylesheet capabilities, like LESS. The absence of variables and dynamic calculations (beyond basic percentages) in plain CSS became frustrating at a few points over the course of our project. One instance where we would have benefited from using LESS was in our rendering of the Add Friend button on the directory page for users with long names - because we absolutely positioned that button, the expanded image container complicated the button&rsquo;s placement. Our fix was to make the button 100% of the width of the container, which looks perfectly fine but honestly was not our original intention. This is an example of a design decision that was forced on us by the constraints of our tools and our lack of experience in website design. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Django</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">One of the most valuable benefits of working on this project was becoming familiar with the Django framework. None of us had ever used Django (Tarik and Peter had never even used a web framework), which made things challenging--to say the least--in our first few weeks. Over time, however, we became familiar and even fond of Django&rsquo;s nuances and peculiarities. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Django is heavy and bulky and its cookie-cutter nature is sometimes unsettling. But its design is also quite elegant. Django&rsquo;s ORM implementation and approach to templating helped us hit our stride--so to speak--once we became comfortable with them.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Admittedly, there were times when we were tempted to write raw SQL instead of relying on the Django ORM. Looking back, our hesitance to write raw SQL was smart in the sense that it helped us learn more about Django, but possibly mistaken given the time we spent doing so. But that aside, our general experience with Django was positive. We all seem to agree that we&rsquo;d use it again for similar projects. But then again, maybe it would be worthwhile to experiment with other frameworks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Future Work</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Despite having met our project feature goals, there are several additional features that we would have implemented if we had the chance. &nbsp;Node.js powered chat is a feature we had optimistically hoped to complete if time allowed. &nbsp;We imagined real-time chat boxes replacing comments on posts, so that each post object on the feed would become its own miniature chat room in which users could discuss a particular subject. &nbsp;This innovative and somewhat unconventional design would require some reorganization of the frontpage to be effective. &nbsp;We imagined the most recent or active posts laid out horizontally across the page for easy access to each of their chat boxes, with older or less active posts found lower down on the feed page.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Additionally, the site would benefit strongly from improved styling of multimedia in posts. Although we currently support youtube video embeds, we don&rsquo;t provide the same manner of functionality for links (e.g. a text preview), images, or videos from sources other than YouTube. On a related note, a filtering mechanism specifically for media would be a very nice feature so that users could easily find all the movies, links, and photos that have been shared within the community.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Conclusions and Final Thoughts</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">Our mission was to create an enhanced communication platform for the Terrace community. To that extent, we strived to build a social network with some custom features that we believed would be particularly beneficial to the community. &nbsp;As we consider our finished product with respect to these initial goals, we are generally pleased with the product. &nbsp;Given more time, we would have liked to implement some of the more advanced user interface features that we&rsquo;ve dreamt up over the past few months, but given the scope of the project we think we have accomplished more than is necessary to prove the value of our product, and we&rsquo;re proud to have been able to build something that we think will become an important part of the experience of future Terrans. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">This project has given us the opportunity to learn a great deal about several interesting technologies. Beyond acquiring and enhancing skills related to actually building product, we also learned best practices related to group management and collaborative development. The workflow we set up for ourselves streamlined our development process and helped us avoid potentially major complications. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">We learned how to work together effectively. We learned to adapt to each other&rsquo;s coding styles. Sometimes we struggled to clearly articulate our product goals and effectively delegate responsibilities in an organized manner. We worked best when each of us chose to own a specific feature and made it that person&rsquo;s responsibility to manage its execution. This helped us make significant improvements to our production speed. Another way in which we improved as a team was coming to understand each other&rsquo;s strengths, weaknesses and preferences; this was invaluable for delegation and troubleshooting. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">We have our fair share of regrets. We should have launched earlier and worked faster--especially in the first weeks of the project. Additionally, there are features we never had the chance to implement. But despite our frustration in these regards, this was above all a learning experience and we&rsquo;re thankful for having had it. &nbsp;</span></p><div><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
